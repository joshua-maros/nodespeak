# Waveguide

Waveguide is a language designed to write short, number-crunching filters that 
run inside of a larger application. It is designed to allow compilation and 
recompilation during the execution of the larger application, such that the
filter can be optimized and reoptimized based on parameters requested by the
user or generated by the application. For example, many filter in image editing
applications have a handful of tunable paramters such as size and strength,
allowing the filter to be more generic at the cost of runtime performance. With
Waveguide, the code for the filter can be written once like always, but
recompiled on the fly based on the parameters the user selects to produce
machine code with minimal overflow from control flow, as well as taking
advantage of any algebraic optimizations that occur from the particular
combination of parameters that the user has selected.

This is currently *very* work in progress, and there is no fully working version
yet.
